Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

Frontend Mentor challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

Where to find everything.
Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the /design folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as font-size, padding and margin. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

Building your project.
1.Intialize your project as a public repository on Github.
2. configure your respository to publish your code toa URL.
3. Look through the designs to start palnning out how you will tackle the project.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as font-family and font-size.

Deploying your project.
As mentioned above, there are a number of ways to host your project for free. We recommend using Vercel as it's an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with. If you'd like to use Vercel, here are some steps to follow to get started:

Sign up to Vercel and go through the onboarding flow, ensuring your GitHub account is connected by using their Vercel for GitHub integration.
Connect your project to Vercel from the "Import project" page, using the "From Git Repository" button and selecting the project you want to deploy.
Once connected, every time you git push, Vercel will create a new deployment and the deployment URL will be shown on your Dashboard. You will also receive an email for each deployment with the URL.
